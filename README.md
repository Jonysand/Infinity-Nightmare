## Description
This is a course[*Intro to Physical Computing*] midterm, Holloween theme project, designed and implelmented by <b>*Fanyi*</b> and <b>*Yongkun*</b>.

The idea came from the concept of trapping a person in a infinite space, like the soul being prisoned in a small cube, but you can see them from every dimension.

## Usage
Walk into the room, stand in front of the cube, and push the button. Then watch yourself crying in the nightmare cube!
